Scene Text Recognition (CRNN and EasyOCR):* Download the required datasets (MJSynth and Scene_Text_Test_Images) and upload them your Google Drive. The software mounts your drive to the notebook to gain access to the datasets. * Open and run the Scene_Text_Recognition. ipynb file on Google Colab. The use of Google Colab’s virtual GPU significantly reduces the training time for text recognition systems. * All libraries are imported directly by the colab so there is no need for you to pre- install any before running the notebook.  Real-Time Video Scene Text Recognition:* The main.py file contains the code for the Real-Time Video Scene Text Recognition software. * This code should be run on PyCharm or via a terminal, as you would any python file.* The libraries required to run the code will need to be installed. This can be done via PyCharm or your terminal.* There are no datasets or files needed in this code. * The software calls a video capture object to access your webcam. It is therefore required that you ensure that the machine you’re working on has a primary webcam built in.
